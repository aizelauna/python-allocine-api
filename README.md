# Python Allocine API

Fully copied and adapted from [the PHP version](https://github.com/gromez/allocine-api) from [Gromez](https://github.com/gromez), who kinda reversed-engineered the Android Allocine app (I guess).

His full documentation can be found [here](https://wiki.gromez.fr/dev/api/allocine_v3)

Requirements : *requests*

```> pip install requests```

Runs fine on both Python2 and Python3
